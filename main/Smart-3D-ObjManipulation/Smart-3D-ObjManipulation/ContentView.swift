 Project Requirements
 1. SceneKit for 3D Object Management
 SceneKit will be responsible for managing the 3D scene, including the object that users will
 interact with. All user interactions, such as translation, rotation, and scaling of the object, will be
 handled through SwiftUI for a declarative, modern approach to macOS app development.
 
 Tasks:
 • Scene Setup:
 ◦ Initialize a SceneKit scene (SCNScene) containing a single 3D object (e.g.,
 SCNSphere, SCNBox). - DONE
 ◦ Attach a camera node and a light source to create realistic lighting effects.- DONE
 • Object Manipulation via User Input (SwiftUI):
 ◦ Use SwiftUI to handle all user-driven interactions, including:
 ▪ Translation: Click and drag gestures to move the object.- DONE
 ▪ Rotation: Drag to rotate the object along arbitrary axes.- DONE
 ▪ Scaling: Implement scaling via mouse wheel or trackpad pinch gestures.- DONE
 ◦ All transformations should update the scene in real time, ensuring smooth
 interactions and responsiveness.- DONE
 
 • Constraints:
 ◦ Camera control will be separate from object transformations. Moving the camera
 should not impact object transformations.- DONE
 
 2. Advanced 3D Matrix Manipulation
 Instead of relying on SceneKit’s default transformation methods, custom 3D transformation
 matrices will be implemented for manipulating the object’s position, rotation, and scale.
 Tasks:
 
 • Matrix-Driven Transformations:
 ◦ Implement custom transformations using 4x4 matrices for translation, rotation, and
 scaling. - DONE
 
 ◦ Rotation: Apply rotation around arbitrary axes (e.g., custom vector axes such as
 Vector(1, 1, 0)).- DONE
 
 ◦ Non-uniform scaling: Implement non-standard scaling (e.g., different scaling
 factors along the X, Y, and Z axes).- DONE
 
 ◦ Translation: Translate the object in 3D space using custom translation matrices.- DONE
 • Projection and Perspective:
 ◦ Design a custom projection matrix to simulate unique perspectives, such as skewed
 field-of-view distortions.- DONE
 
 ------ NOT DONE -------------
 • Matrix Compositions:
 ◦ Combine multiple transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) into a single
 transformation matrix, ensuring the proper sequence of operations.
 
 3. Metal for Custom Rendering
 Metal shaders will be used for rendering the object, replacing SceneKit’s default rendering
 pipeline. The shaders should update the object’s appearance dynamically based on its
 transformation matrix and the scene’s light source.
 Tasks:
 • Phong or Blinn-Phong Shading:
 ◦ Implement custom Metal shaders that use Phong or Blinn-Phong shading models
 for realistic lighting.
 ◦ Calculate ambient, diffuse, and specular components based on the object’s surface
 normals and light direction.
 ------ NOT DONE -------------

 DONE:
 • Dynamic Appearance Changes:
 ◦ Modify the object’s appearance based on its transformation. For example, apply
 color changes or glow effects as the object rotates. -> DONE
 
 DONE:
 • Reflection or Bump Mapping:
 ◦ Implement bump mapping or reflection mapping to simulate surface imperfections
 and reflective surfaces. These effects should update dynamically based on the
 object’s position and orientation.
 
 • Real-Time Shader Updates:
 ◦ Ensure that Metal shaders are updated in real time, reflecting changes in the object’s
 transformations and scene lighting.
 
 4. SceneKit-Metal Integration with SwiftUI
 SwiftUI will serve as the interface layer, managing user input and interaction. SceneKit will handle
 scene management, while Metal will take over rendering tasks. The interaction between all three
 technologies should be seamless, providing a fluid and performant user experience.
 Tasks:
 • Metal Shader Integration:
 ◦ Apply custom Metal shaders using SCNProgram or SCNShadable in
 SceneKit, ensuring Metal handles the rendering while SceneKit manages the object.
 • Real-Time Material Rendering:
 ◦ Use Metal shaders to define the object’s material properties, including textures,
 normals, and specular highlights.
 • Performance Optimization:
 ◦ Optimize the Metal rendering pipeline to ensure smooth performance, even with
 real-time shader updates.
 5. Real-Time User Interaction (SwiftUI)
 All user interactions, such as translation, rotation, and scaling, will be handled by SwiftUI, ensuring
 a consistent and responsive user experience. The object’s appearance and behavior should respond
 immediately to user input.
 Tasks:
 • Real-Time Interaction:
 ◦ Implement rotation, translation, and scaling of the 3D object using SwiftUI gestures
 (drag, pinch, etc.).
 • Smooth Transitions:
 ◦ Ensure that the object transitions smoothly between transformations, with no
 stuttering or performance drops.
 • Input-to-Transformation Mapping:
 ◦ Map 2D input gestures to 3D transformations, providing visual feedback that
 reflects real-time changes in the object’s size, position, and orientation.
